On April 1, 2017, while searching for sources of water, NASA’s Spirit rover encountered a higher life form: Martians! Note that our early efforts to communicate with Martians were unsuccessful, in part, because of our archaic time system. Martians are fully metrics. They measure the length of a single day and a single year using Mars rotational characteristics. However, for the benefit of both civilizations, Martians and us struck a compromise: metric Earth time. Since there are 86,400 seconds in an Earth day, the Martians set the length of a second at 1/100,000 of an Earth day. The compromise keeps seconds at about the same length of time as a traditional second. There are 100 metric seconds in a metric minute and ten metric minutes in a metric hour (leaving 100 metric hours in a day). The program metricTime.py will create an Earth-time-to-Metric-time converter to let us communicate times with the Martians.

Erin, the Equestrian Club president, is holding a monthly club meeting during dinner. She needs to buy enough pizza for the club. She knows how many "standard” pizza (say 16-inch pizza) slices the club will eat, but she will not buy "standard" pizzas. To save money, Erin will buy the equivalent number of Super Pies! Given the size of a “standard” pie, the number of slices in a “standard” pie, the number of “standard” slices the club will eat, and the size of the Super Pie!, the program will determine the number of Super Pies! to buy.

File: pool.py

Peter, the pool boy, has a pool that needs additional water. He needs to add water to it from a garden hose connected to the homeowner’s house. He needs to determine, given a rate of flow, how long it will take to fill the pool to the desired depth so he can tell the homeowner when to turn the hose off. He knows:

  1. The length of the pool.
  2. The width of the pool.
  3. The inches of water needed to raise the water level to the correct depth.
  4. The rate of flow of the garden hose. 

With Peter's knowledge, the program will determine how long it will take to add water.

File: watch.py

Tom, the time-keeper, has just bought a new designer watch. It has 12 crystal clear cubic zirconium chips denoting each hour. Unfortunately, when he got the watch, Tom did not realize it is impossible to tell the top (12 o’clock) from the bottom (6 o’clock) since the watch is symmetric in every way. Fortunately, the watch specialist at Target set the watch to the correct time. Thus, either Tom has to wear the watch correctly, or he will have to read the time upside down. Tom chooses to read the time upside down (when necessary). The program will take the “time” as it appears on Tom's watch as input and tells him what time it is if the watch is upside-down. Tom will only have to determine which of the two times is correct.

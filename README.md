Nigel from NASA has a problem for you. On April 1, 2017, while searching for sources of water, NASA’s Spirit rover encountered a higher life form: Martians! Early efforts at communication were difficult, in part, because of our archaic time system. You see, Martians are fully metric. In addition, their concept of the length of a day and length of a year are based on Mars rotational characteristics. So, the Martians struck a compromise: metric Earth time. Since there are 86,400 seconds in an Earth day, they set the length of a second at 1/100,000 of an Earth day. This keeps seconds at about the same length of time as a traditional second. There are 100 metric seconds in a metric minute and 10 metric minutes in a metric hour (leaving
100 metric hours in a day). The program is an Earth time to Metric time converter so we can easily communicate times with our new friends. 

File: pizzas.py

Erin the Equestrian Club president is holding a monthly club meeting during dinner. She needs to buy enough pizza for the club. She knows how many “standard” pizza (say 16-inch pizzas) slices the club will eat, but she isn’t going to buy standard pizzas. In order to save money, Erin will buy the equivalent number of Super Pies! Given the size of a standard pie, the number of slices in a standard pie, the number of standard slices the club will eat, and the size of the Super Pie!, what is the number of Super Pies! to buy.

File: pool.py

Peter the pool boy has a pool that needs additional water. He needs to add water to the pool from a garden hose connected to the homeowner’s house. He needs to determine, given a rate of flow, how long it will take to fill the pool to the desired depth so he can tell the homeowner when to turn the hose off. He knows:
1. The length of the pool.
2. The width of the pool.
3. The number of inches of water needed to raise the pool to the correct depth.
4. The rate of flow of the garden hose.
He needs to know how long it will take to add water.

File: watch.py

Tom the time-keeper has just bought a new designer watch. It has 12 crystal clear cubic zirconium chips denoting each hour. Unfortunately, when Tom bought the watch, he didn’t realize it isn’t possible to tell the top (12 o’clock) from the bottom (6 o’clock) since the watch is symmetric in every way. Fortunately, the watch specialist at Target set the watch to the correct time, so Tom just has to either put the watch on correctly, or he has to master reading the time upside down. Tom chooses to read the time upside down (when necessary), so he writes a python program to help him
out. Tom’s program works as follows: Tom enters the “time” as it appears on his watch. The program tells him what time it is if the watch is upside-down. Tom just has to determine which of the two times is correct.
